### Abstract:

Predicting cardiovascular health stands as a critical imperative in modern healthcare, demanding the deployment of sophisticated and potent predictive models. The study seeks a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture network model for the predicting of heart disease. The dataset consists of 51 feature columns with a large records base of 37079 depicting different patient profiles. This study shows that the proposed architecture of the MLP model effectively captures deep patterns within the data. The research journey begins with specific care in preprocessing. It was not merely about compiling data: filling in the blanks, deleting duplicates, and finally using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) to correct the original class imbalance problems for oversampling the minority samples. After describing the proposed architecture, the model has undergone extensive training and evaluation, resulting in notable results. The model has achieved a test accuracy of 97.10%. The model has once again proven its capability of identifying a positive case with sensitivity and precision values of 97.85% and 96.40% respectively while keeping away false positives. In a process where abstract numbers take shape, the explainability of the model provides a whole new dimension of transparency in the decision-making process.

The study shows the top features using the SHAP values and plots the summary (swarm) and bar plots according to their weightage. Through the SHAP technique, the proposed model gives transparency, and traceability and gets the medical staff‚Äôs trust and credibility in decision-making. XAI algorithms like (SHAP, LIME, FairML, etc) are redefining the AI model‚Äôs architectures, implementation, scope, deployment criteria, transparency, and trustworthiness in their decision or outcome.
