# Thesis title: "Enhancing Heart Disease Prediction with Explainable AI (XAI)"
### Abstract:

Predicting cardiovascular health stands as a critical imperative in modern healthcare, demanding the deployment of sophisticated and potent predictive models. This study undertakes the ambitious task of advancing predictive modeling for coronary heart disease through the innovative integration of attention-layer-based multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture network model. The dataset under scrutiny encompasses a rich tapestry of 51 distinct characteristics distributed across 37079 records, offering a comprehensive and nuanced depiction of diverse patient profiles. The heart of this study lies in the proposed model's architecture, where attention mechanisms play a pivotal role in capturing intricate patterns within the data. The MLP architecture, augmented with attention layers, exhibits a unique ability to focus on salient features and relationships, enhancing the model's capacity to discern complex patterns associated with coronary heart disease. The research journey commences with meticulous preprocessing procedures, transcending the mere compilation of data. Addressing missing information, eliminating duplicates, and deploying the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) collectively form an integral part of the data preparation phase. The inclusion of SMOTE not only rectifies inherent class imbalances but also enhances the model's robustness by oversampling minority instances. Following the architectural exposition, the network undergoes extensive training and meticulous evaluation, culminating in impressive outcomes. The model achieves a test accuracy of 97.10%, underscoring its efficacy in discerning instances of the target class. Sensitivity and precision, measuring 97.85% and 96.40% respectively, showcase the model's prowess in accurately identifying positive cases while minimizing false positives. Furthermore, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric serves as a testament to the model's discriminative power, further validating its clinical relevance. Beyond the numerical achievements, the interpretability of the model is a noteworthy feature, adding a layer of transparency to the decision-making process. 

This research significantly contributes to the burgeoning field of cardiovascular health prediction, presenting a model that excels not only in accuracy but also in interpretability. The amalgamation of advanced attention mechanisms, diverse neural network architectures, and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques positions this study at the forefront of predictive modeling for critical healthcare applications. As the model proves its mettle in discerning intricate patterns within cardiovascular datasets, the implications for improved patient care and proactive intervention become increasingly tangible.
